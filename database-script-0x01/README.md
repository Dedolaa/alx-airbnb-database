# Airbnb Database Schema

This SQL script (`schema.sql`) defines the database schema for a simplified Airbnb platform. It includes the necessary `CREATE TABLE` statements to model the following entities:

- **User**
- **Property**
- **Booking**
- **Payment**
- **Review**
- **Message**

Each table includes appropriate:
- Data types
- Primary and foreign keys
- Constraints (e.g., ENUMs, CHECKs)
- Indexes for optimization
